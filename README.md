# Dublin Core to MARC-21

Code Repository for metadata conversion from Dublin Core (DC) to MARC-21.

For more information, please contact claus.zinn@uni-tuebingen.de

# Website

This web service allows you to convert a DC Simple metadata file to the MARC-21 format.

It makes use of a stylesheet retrieved from http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/xslt/DC2MARC21slim.xsl.

The conversion from DC to MARC-21 is currently being served at:

```http://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/converter/DC2Marc/ ```

A REST interface is also available. See webpage above.

# Status

The software has no official release yet, but won't change much in the future, given the stylesheet's fixed nature.
